# Numerical-Methods-in-Python

This repository presents a comprehensive and modular implementation of **Numerical Methods**, covering key topics in scientific computing. Each method is implemented as a Python function with accompanying **Jupyter notebooks** that demonstrate accuracy, efficiency, and visual comparisons using real problems.

This work reflects both algorithmic understanding and practical numerical analysis skills, developed through structured coding, symbolic computation, and clear presentation.

The codes were built following the algorithms of book **Numerical Analysis (9th Edition) -Richard L. Burden, J. Douglas Faires**.
